4. make 3 files in each folder (UserRepository, User, Usercontroller)
5. Change application preoperties


frontend
1. in the folder run 'npx create-react-app myfrontend'
2. install webpack as 'npm install webpack --save-dev' 
// in app.js we include other main files(nav, home, footer) which are exported and main entry file is index.js. 
//now index.html diplays all of this. therefore we bundle it and in index.html 
//we write script src as bundle.js that contains all the js bundled file
//webpack helps to link all files toghther and we only have to import bundle.js and not other scripts individually
3. npm install --save-dev babel-cli
//modern javascript feature support, tranform code from 1 format to another(eg arrow fucntion in js into normal function)




3. command "webpack index.js ./bundle.js" 
//creates a bundle.js file that combines all files mentioned in index.js(app.js) 
4. create webpack.config.js file and write conf and run 'webpack' (id doesnt work run 'npm install -g webpack' then 'webpack') or to run on localhost:8080:
'npm install webpack-dev-server -g' then 'webpack-dev-server' then 'localhost:8080'
//to avoid above command everytime a file is added. creates bundle.js
5. copy package.json file and run "npm install"
//build:webpack- creates bundle.js and dev-server(webconfig) uses bundle.js to run

6. 'npm install @babel/preset-react' and make changes to .babelrc as @babelenv and @babelreact
